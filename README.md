# Gavin M Costa Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Gavin Michael Costa, a passionate software engineer currently embarking on my coding journey through Thinkful's bootcamp.

## 👨‍💻 About Me
After college, my diverse career journey led me to discover my passion for supporting business operations through technology. As a former freelancer, I've honed my skills in clean coding, code articulation, and autonomous teamwork with peer reviews.

## 💡 Coding Interests
I thrive on:
- Developing tools for business functionality
- Following best coding practices
- Communicating code in layman and technical terms
- Collaborating within a team autonomously

## 🚀 Aspiring Software Engineer
In my previous role as "Lead Field Technician," I immersed myself in vibration technology, supporting construction sites through community outreach and daily concise readouts for compliance.

Coding for me is not just a profession; it's a passion. I enjoy learning, overcoming challenges, and exploring the vast possibilities of coding. As a tech nerd, I look forward to applying my skills learned at Thinkful's boot camp in both professional settings and supporting my hobbies.
